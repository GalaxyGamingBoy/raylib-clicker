# Raylib Clicker

This is a Clicker Game that I am currently working on using Raylib and **_pure_** C++!

## Build Instructions

A build script has been make for Windows, Linux[\*](#notes--other) and Gitpod[\*](#notes--other).

1. Make sure you have `CMake` installed in your systems, as well as any depedencies. [View them here](#dependencies-per-system)

2. Run `buildWin.ps1` to build for Windows, or `buildLinux.sh` to build for Linux systems[\*](#notes--other).

3. **_Success!_**
